Scintillation Slab With WLS and Cladding
=======================================

Simulation of optical photon collection in a scintillation bar that is wrapped in a wavelength shifting plasitc and ecnased in an optical cladding.

GEOMETRY:
---------
The geometry is a thin 100 um slab that is 30 cm wide by 200 cm long.  There are two rectangular PMT's attached to either end of the bar.  The bar is encased in a plastic that can be set to a wavelength shifter. The entire assembly is wrapped in an optical covering (tape, mylar, air).
