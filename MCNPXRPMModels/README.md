Simulation of RPM8 with MCNPX
=============================

Simulation of the RPM8 geometries with MCNPX. Two differnet types of models are considered, a layered detector design and a wrapped cylinder design. The layered detector design consits of planar layers of detector material. The wrapped cylinders is a central cylinder that has detector layers wrapped around it.
