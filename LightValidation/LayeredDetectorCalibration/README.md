Layered Detector Calibration
============================

Simulation of gammas and neutrons and the subsquent energy depsotion and optical photons of three layered detectors. 

The detector assembly is two thin films sandwhiched between three PMMA slices, mounted with optical grease. The entire assembly was wrapped with teflon and black tape. A fish tail light guide was used to collect the light.

Naming Conventions:
  Abosrber - the Scintillator
  PMT - the pmt

The seperate histograms can be combined with the following command.
  `hadd GS20_Neutron.root GS20_Neutron_*.root`
