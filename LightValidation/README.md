Light Validation
================

Validation of the light transport simulations and the quantaties that are used in the models.

Projects:

 + BirksConstantEffect - Examining the effects of the Birks coefficient on materials and the light yields
 + SingleDetectorCalibration - A simulation of GS20 as measured (except using a neutron and gamma gun sources) and A PS Film
