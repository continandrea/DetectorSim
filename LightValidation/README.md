Light Validation
================

Validation of the light transport simulations and the quantities that are used in the models.

Projects:

 + BirksConstantEffect - Examining the effects of the Birks coefficient on materials and the light yields
 + GS20Calibration - A simulation of GS20 as measured (except using a neutron and gamma gun sources) and the number of optical photons detected and measured
 + PSCalibration - A simulation of PS as measured (except using a neutron and gamma gun sources) and the number of optical photons detected and measured
 + LayeredDetectorCalibration - A simulation of a 4" by 6" slab detector that was fabricated and measured at UTK. This simulation validates the number of optical photons detected and measured.
