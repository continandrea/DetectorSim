G4DetectorSim
=============

Simulation of Radiation Detectors with GEANT4

# Simulated Physics and Detectors
  
These simulations are intended to highlight basic physics of scintillators

  + LightQuenching - Studies the light quenching in a simple scintilllator
  + ParticleTracks - A demonstration of the track structure from different charged particles
  + RangeSim - Simulates the range of various charged particles
