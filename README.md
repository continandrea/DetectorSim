DetectorSim
===========

Simulation of Radiation Detectors with GEANT4 and MCNPX

## Simulated Physics and Detectors
  
These simulations are intended to highlight basic physics of scintillators

  + LightQuenching - Studies the light quenching in a simple scintilllator
  + ParticleTracks - A demonstration of the track structure from different charged particles
  + RangeSim - Simulates the range of various charged particles

The following simulations are intended to expore more complex interactions of a detector.

  + LightYieldEDep - The light yield as a function of energy deposition and film thickness

## Light Background
  
  + ScintillationSlab - A single scintillation bar. The optical photons are collected on a single PMT
  + WLSScintBar - A single scintillating bar sandwiched between two WLS shifting bars

## LightValidation

Simulations for the light validation of differnet detector designs. The simulations included are:

  + GS20Calibration
  + PSCalibration
  + LayeredDetectorValidation
